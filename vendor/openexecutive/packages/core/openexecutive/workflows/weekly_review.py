"""Weekly review — the principal's week, looked back on and planned forward.

A background workflow. In solo mode the scheduler fires it once a week (a
``principal_weekly_review`` row, Friday 16:00 in the user's zone by default)
and delivers the artifact to the principal like the briefs; it can also be
run by hand in either mode.

Steps
-----
1. ``goals``        Each area's goals graded by that area's specialist, with
                    the department check-in's verdict contract
                    (``_parse_verdicts``) and write-back
                    (``persist_goal_verdicts`` → ``record_goal_review``). An
                    area with no goals is skipped; one with no specialist is
                    listed ungraded.
2. ``commitments``  The principal's commitments overdue or due in the next
                    seven days (``open_loops.principal_due_soon``).
3. ``projects``     Active projects (initiatives) untouched for 7+ days.
4. ``decisions``    The decisions logged this week.
5. ``revisit``      Up to three decisions older than 30 days with no outcome
                    recorded — "how did this turn out?". The principal's
                    answer is recorded with ``record_decision_outcome``.
6. ``assemble``     The Markdown review, ending with next week's top three
                    (one fast-model call following the ``weekly-review``
                    playbook; a ranked pick in code when that call fails).

Wording is role-neutral: the principal may run a business, lead a function
inside a larger organisation, or work independently.
