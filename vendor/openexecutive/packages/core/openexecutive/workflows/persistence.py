"""SQLite persistence for workflow runs.

Reuses the same DB file as `memory/episodic.py` (so a single backup covers
everything). The table is initialized lazily on first write.

Phase 6 additions
-----------------
Four columns added via idempotent ALTER:
  state_json     TEXT     — checkpoint dict (on_timeout, channel, etc.)
  awaiting_person_id INTEGER — person we're waiting on
  awaiting_until TEXT     — ISO timestamp for timeout
  resolution_json TEXT    — serialized WaitForHumanResolution on match

Resume additions
----------------
Three more columns, same idempotent ALTER:
  resume_state_json TEXT    — serialized WorkflowResumeState; NULL means the
                              gate is pause-only and nothing will continue it
  resumed_at        TEXT    — ISO timestamp a resume was claimed at, so a
                              worker that dies mid-resume can be found again
  resume_attempts   INTEGER — bounded retries for that requeue, reset at each
                              new gate (a new gate is new work, not a retry)
  resume_claim      TEXT    — fencing token for the live claim; a worker's
                              terminal write is refused once it is superseded

New status values beyond running/done/error:
  awaiting_human — paused, waiting for a human reply
  resolved       — human replied, resolution stored in resolution_json.
                   NOT terminal when resume_state_json is set: the resumer
                   claims such a row (resolved -> running) and executes the
                   steps after the gate.
  timed_out      — awaiting_until passed, timeout policy applied
