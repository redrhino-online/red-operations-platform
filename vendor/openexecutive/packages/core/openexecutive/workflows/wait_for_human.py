"""WaitForHuman workflow primitive — pause/resume across async human replies.

A workflow yields a ``WaitForHumanEvent`` to pause itself at an approval
gate. The caller (scheduler cadence runner or workflow HTTP runner) calls
``save_checkpoint`` and exits; the run sits in ``status='awaiting_human'``.

The ``run_resumer`` background loop watches for timeouts.  The inbound
resolver (Slack / Telegram / email hooks) calls ``apply_resolution`` when
a human replies, which stores the ``WaitForHumanResolution`` and advances
the run to ``status='resolved'``.

Resume
------
A gate that carries a :class:`WorkflowResumeState` is *resumable*: once the
decision is recorded, ``resumer._execute_resume`` re-enters the workflow at
the step after the gate and drives it to an artifact.  Nothing serialises a
Python generator frame — the state is the small, plain-JSON payload below,
and the engine replays its step loop from an index.

A gate with no resume state is *pause-only*: the decision is recorded and
the run stops there.  That is what every caller got before resume existed,
and it is still what a workflow yielding a bare ``WaitForHumanEvent`` gets.
