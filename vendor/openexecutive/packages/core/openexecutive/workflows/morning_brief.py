"""Morning brief workflow — a short proactive briefing to the principal.

Renders a one-screen Markdown summary covering:
  • At-risk department goals
  • Proposals awaiting the principal's decision
  • Anything OE acted on since the last brief
  • The top decision the principal needs to make today
  • In solo mode: what is due this week, and the top three to focus on today
    (``briefing.top_three`` — with a free slot for each when a calendar can
    be read)

The scheduler fires a `principal_brief_morning` action once per day at
the configured time (default 08:00 UTC) which runs this workflow and
DMs the artifact to the principal via their preferred channel. The
workflow can also be triggered manually through the workflow API for
testing or to re-send.

Target audience is hardcoded to the principal — this is a
personal-rhythm artifact, not org-coordination. See the
`## Choosing Who to Tell` section in the persona for the broader
audience-selection rules.
