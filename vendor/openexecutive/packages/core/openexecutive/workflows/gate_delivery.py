"""Deliver a wait-for-human gate's question, and record where to look for the answer.

Before this module, a workflow that paused at an approval gate was a dead end
(#136). ``dynamic.py`` built the ``WaitForHumanEvent`` with no ``channel``,
``channel_ref`` or ``outbound_message_id``, and the two checkpoint sites wrote
that empty state straight to ``workflow_runs.state_json``. Consequences:

* Nobody was ever *asked*. The run sat at ``awaiting_human`` until it timed
  out, and the only place it surfaced was the /today dashboard.
* Even if the approver had guessed, the inbound resolver could not match
  their reply: tier 2 filters candidates on ``state["channel"] == channel``,
  which was always ``""``.

So the primitive existed on paper and resolved nothing on any channel. This
module fills in the routing fields and — when the approver is not the person
already in the conversation — actually sends the question.

Two modes:

1. **Chat-origin self-approval.** A person launched the workflow from a chat
   channel and is themselves the approver. Sending them a separate DM would be
   absurd — the Executive is about to put the question in its own reply. Record
   the session and channel so their next message in that conversation resolves
   the gate, and send nothing.

2. **Out-of-band.** A web ``/jobs`` run, a scheduled run, or a gate addressed
   to someone other than the launcher. Delegate to
   ``schedule_tools.handle_message_person``, which already does
   preferred-channel selection, per-channel id validation, fall-through on a
   failed send, and an alert fallback when nothing is reachable. Do not
   reimplement any of that here.

Delivery can legitimately not happen — the anti-spam guard suppresses
duplicates, rate-cap breaches and quiet-hours sends, and an unreachable person
falls back to an alert. In both cases the question is NOT sitting somewhere the
approver can reply to, so the routing fields stay empty and the caller reports
the real ``delivery`` state rather than implying someone was asked.

Never raises: a delivery problem must not fail the run that is trying to pause.
