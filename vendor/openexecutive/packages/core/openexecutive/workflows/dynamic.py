"""The generic engine that runs a user-created workflow definition.

``DynamicWorkflow`` wraps a stored :class:`DynamicWorkflowDef` and implements
the :class:`Workflow` ABC by *interpreting* the definition's steps — there is
no per-workflow code. It reuses the exact building blocks the hand-written
workflows use (``load_or_create_profile``, ``retrieve``,
``route_to_specialist``) so a dynamic workflow behaves like a built-in: same
SSE events, same artifact shape, same run persistence.

Step interpretation:
- ``specialist``  → consult the named specialist with the rendered goal
                    (and optional RAG), store the output.
- ``approval_gate`` → yield a ``WaitForHumanEvent`` carrying a
                    ``WorkflowResumeState``. The caller checkpoints and pauses;
                    once the human answers, ``resume()`` re-enters at the next
                    step (see "Pause and resume" below).
- ``synthesis``   → assemble prior outputs into the final Markdown artifact,
                    either by concatenation or via one synthesis consult.
- ``action``      → run the ``workflow_actor`` agent with ONLY the step's
                    approved tools (``workflows/action_step.py``); its report
                    of what it did becomes the step's output.

Pause and resume
----------------
``run()`` and ``resume()`` share one step loop, ``_run_steps``, which takes
the index to start at and the outputs accumulated so far. That is the whole
mechanism: nothing serialises a generator frame. At a gate the engine hands
the caller a ``WorkflowResumeState`` (workflow name, gate id and index, next
index, completed outputs); on resume the caller hands it back, the engine
re-validates it against the live definition, records the human's decision as
the gate step's own output, and runs the loop from the next index.

A second gate needs no special handling — it is simply another pause raised
from the same loop, with a fresh payload.
