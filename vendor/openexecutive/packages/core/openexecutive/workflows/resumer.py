"""Background resumer loop — timeouts, and continuing runs past their gate.

Mirrors ``scheduler/runner.py``'s polling pattern.

What it does
------------
* **Timeouts**: when ``awaiting_until <= now``, apply the ``on_timeout``
  policy (escalate / auto_proceed / fail).
* ``apply_resolution``: called by the inbound resolver (Slack / Discord /
  Telegram) when a human replies. Stores the resolution, marks the run
  ``resolved``, writes an audit entry.  Idempotent — a second call on the
  same run_id is a no-op (returns False).
* **Resume**: a ``resolved`` run carrying a ``resume_state_json`` payload is
  claimed (``resolved`` -> ``running``) and driven to completion — the steps
  after the gate actually execute and produce the artifact.

How resume works
----------------
Nothing serialises a Python generator frame; that assumption is what deferred
this for so long.  The engine hands out a small JSON payload at the gate (see
``WorkflowResumeState``) and ``DynamicWorkflow.resume`` replays its step loop
from the recorded index.  This module supplies the missing half: the human
replies hours later in a different process, with the original SSE connection
long gone, so *something* has to pick the run back up.  That something is
``_process_resumable``, reached two ways:

1. Immediately, via a task ``apply_resolution`` kicks off — so a Slack
   approval starts work in seconds rather than at the next poll.
2. From ``_tick``, 60s at a time — the durable backstop for a kick that never
   ran (process restart) or crashed.

Both go through ``claim_run_for_resume``, one guarded UPDATE, so whichever
gets there first wins and the other does nothing.

Concurrency
-----------
Single-worker *by intent*, not by safety: ``api/main.py`` starts this loop
unconditionally, so two API replicas means two resumers.  The atomic claim
makes that safe — a run executes once — but the loop now does real, billable
specialist work rather than flipping statuses, so running one per database is
still the deployment contract.
