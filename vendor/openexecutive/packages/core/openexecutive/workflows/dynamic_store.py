"""SQLite persistence for user-created ("dynamic") workflow definitions.

Mirrors ``workflows/persistence.py`` conventions: same DB file as
``memory/episodic.py`` (one backup covers everything), lazy idempotent table
creation, and a ``db_path`` override on every function so tests can point at a
temp DB.

The full definition is stored as JSON in the ``definition`` column; ``name``
and ``is_active`` are also denormalised into columns so the registry
fall-through (``workflows/__init__.py``) can list active definitions without
deserialising every row's body.
