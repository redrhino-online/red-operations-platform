"""End-of-day digest workflow — a short proactive recap to the principal.

Renders a one-screen Markdown summary covering:
  • What OE did today on its own initiative
  • What's still pending / awaiting decisions
  • What's at risk for tomorrow
  • One thing the principal might sleep on before deciding

The scheduler fires a `principal_brief_eod` action once per day at the
configured time (default 18:00 UTC) which runs this workflow and DMs
the artifact to the principal via their preferred channel. Manual
invocation through the workflow API is also supported for testing.

Target audience is hardcoded to the principal — see the
`## Choosing Who to Tell` section in the persona for why EoD digests
are a personal-rhythm artifact rather than an org-coordination
broadcast.
