    """Build system prompt blocks with correct cache_control ordering.

    Block layout (max 2 blocks, total cache_control budget ≤ 2 here so that
    the caller's tool block + message cache stay within the API limit of 4):
      - Block 0: persona + knowledge index (1h TTL, always present)
      - Block 1: company profile + org/dept context (5m TTL, only if non-empty)

    RAG context is injected into the user turn, NOT here.

    persona_override replaces the built-in persona when the Agent Council
    has a saved override for the "executive" agent_id.

    workspace_mode ("team" / "solo", from ``effective_workspace_mode``) picks
    the built-in persona — EXECUTIVE_PERSONA_PROMPT or
    EXECUTIVE_PERSONA_SOLO_PROMPT, both constants — and the org block variant.
    An override still wins as-is in either mode. The mode is stable per
    install, so each mode keeps its own warm cache; a switch misses once.

    principal_role is the role the solo org block renders in block 1 (the
    turn's ``effective_principal_role``; None reads the workspace's). It is
    set once per install, so it is as stable as the rest of block 1. Team
    mode ignores it.

    persona_instructions are the admin's additional instructions for the
    Executive, appended after the (built-in or overridden) persona and voice.
    Admin-set like persona_override, so block 0 misses once on save and stays
    warm; blank or None leaves block 0 byte-identical.

    voice_persona_body is substituted into the {VOICE_PERSONA} placeholder in
    the assembled base prompt. If the placeholder is absent (user removed it),
    the body is appended at the end of the prompt so it is never silently dropped.

    include_contacts adds the principal's private Contacts section to block 1.
    The caller passes it only for the principal's own verified turn, so per
    mode block 1 has exactly two stable variants (with and without contacts)
    — never anything per-request.

    delegation appends the constant DELEGATION_ADDENDUM (Act as me) after the
    identity addendum, which stays exactly as it is. The caller passes the
    install-level "anyone has it on" flag
    (``delegation.settings.block0_delegation_on``), never a per-turn or
    per-speaker value, so block 0 changes only when the setting does; off, it
    is byte-identical to before.

    mcp_servers names the MCP servers the running gateway was started with
    (empty when there is none). With the channel settings it renders the
    *Connected Systems* section (prompts.connected_systems)
    after the identity addendum: what is on, and the pinned Google tool names.
    All of it is fixed per process or install, so block 0 stays warm.
