"""What the Executive is connected to, told to the model in cached block 0.

Without this the model learns what is connected only by calling
``search_tools``, an uncached proxy whose results are gone by the next turn
(prior turns replay as plain text), so it rediscovers the Google tools on most
turns and, when a search comes back empty, tells the user it can't see their
Gmail. ``render_connected_systems`` states what is on and pins the exact
Google tool names it uses constantly, so those are called directly.

Every input is fixed for the process (the MCP servers the gateway started
with, the integration settings in the environment) and the output is sorted,
so block 0's 1h cache stays warm.
