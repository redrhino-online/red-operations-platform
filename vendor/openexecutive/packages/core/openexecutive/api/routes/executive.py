"""Pause / resume the Executive's autonomous work (scheduler/pause.py).

Behind the global shared-secret middleware like every other route, and
deliberately NOT behind ``SCHEDULED_ADMIN_TOKEN``: the web UI's proxy cannot
send that header, and the switch has to work from any page.

The two directions are authorized differently. **Pause** is the safe
direction — it only holds work — so any signed-in caller may pull the brake.
**Resume** releases every held outbound action at once, so it is the
principal's alone (``people.store.is_principal_or_self``, the same rule the
people routes use). Until a principal is on the roster nobody could pass that
check, so resume is then open rather than leaving a pause no one can lift.

``paused_by`` comes from the ``x-caller-email`` the UI proxy stamps from the
signed-in session; direct API callers fall back to ``"api"``.
