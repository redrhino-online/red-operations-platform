"""Conversational workflow design (``/workflows/designer/*``).

The ``/jobs/new`` wizard: the user describes a job, the designer asks
clarifying questions, and the result is a DRAFT ``DynamicWorkflowDef`` the
user reviews. Nothing here writes — the UI saves the reviewed draft through
``POST /workflows/custom``, which validates it again and owns persistence and
cadence scheduling. The step-by-step builder stays reachable as the advanced
editor.

Mounted BEFORE ``workflows.router`` in ``api/main.py`` so no
``/workflows/{name}/...`` pattern can shadow these literal paths (the same
rule ``workflows.py`` follows for ``/workflows/custom`` and ``/workflows/runs``).

Every 4xx/5xx detail below is a fixed string and every log line carries an
exception TYPE, never user or model text.
