"""Workspace settings: solo / team mode, the user's time zone, and the
principal's role (what they do — solo mode reads it; see
``memory.workspace_settings.PrincipalRole``).

``GET /workspace`` is open to any caller. ``PUT /workspace`` changes how the
whole install behaves — solo mode cancels every department check-in, and a
new zone re-times the principal's briefs — so it is the principal's alone,
by the same rule as resuming the Executive
(``chat._caller_is_principal_or_unclaimed``): a caller that resolves to the
principal (a request with no ``x-caller-email`` — the CLI, direct curl, local
login — does), or anyone while no principal is on the roster yet, so
first-run setup can choose a mode before onboarding has created one.

The principal's role (who they report to, what they are measured on) is
theirs: ``GET`` returns it only to a caller that ``PUT`` would let through,
and reads it back as nulls for anyone else (a teammate on a team install).
So are the company's email domains (``company_domains``, empty for anyone
else): they decide which addresses match a teammate by local part
(``people.identity``).

Both routes work before onboarding: nothing here needs a company profile.
