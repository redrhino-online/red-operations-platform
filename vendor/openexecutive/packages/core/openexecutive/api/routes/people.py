"""FastAPI routes for People.

Phase 3 surface: CRUD + archive + approver lookup.
All mutations invalidate the 60s registry cache so the next
Executive turn picks up the change. Adding, editing and archiving
people are the principal's alone (``_require_roster_owner``).

``GET /people`` lists team members only unless ``include_contacts=true`` (the
People page asks for both; pickers such as a department head or a workflow
approver keep the default and never offer a contact).

Contacts are private to the principal. ``include_contacts`` is honoured only
for a caller that resolves to the principal (``caller_is_principal``), a
contact's id reads as 404 for anyone else on the read routes — and the write
routes refuse anyone else before looking the id up — so its existence is not
revealed, and only the principal may create a contact or turn someone into
one. ``GET /people/me`` tells the UI whether to offer contacts at all.
