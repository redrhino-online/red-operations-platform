"""Setup status: one plain-language light per part of an install.

Backs ``GET /setup/status`` (api/routes/setup_status.py), which the UI's
Settings → Setup status page renders next to the sign-in light it works out
itself. Each check answers "is this part working — and if not, what exactly
do I do?" for someone who has never read this code.

Every check keeps three rules:
- No secret in a response or a log line. A probe that carries a token reports
  a status code, a service's short error code or an exception's class name —
  never the exception's text, which can quote the request URL.
- At most one cheap, read-only call per service. Nothing here sends a
  message, spends model tokens or changes state.
- Every call is bounded by ``PROBE_TIMEOUT_S``: a slow service turns amber
  instead of stalling the page.
