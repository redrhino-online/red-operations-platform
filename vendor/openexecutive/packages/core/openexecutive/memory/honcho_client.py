"""Thin async wrapper around the self-hosted Honcho memory service.

Honcho gives us per-person long-term memory keyed off ``Person.id`` so the
Executive can recall facts about a user across Slack, Discord, Telegram,
email, and the web UI in one peer card. This module exposes three
surfaces the orchestrator calls per turn:

- :func:`prefetch` — returns a short ``<peer_memory>`` block about the
  inbound user that the Executive injects into the user turn (never the
  system block — see ``CLAUDE.md`` / prompt caching rules). By default
  (``HONCHO_PREFETCH_MODE=representation``) it reads the peer's derived
  representation and card, ranked against the inbound message: a GET with
  no LLM behind it. ``HONCHO_PREFETCH_MODE=dialectic`` asks Honcho a
  reasoned question instead (``peer.aio.chat``, an LLM call), where
  ``reasoning_level`` trades latency for synthesis depth. Bounded by
  ``Settings.honcho_prefetch_timeout_s`` so a Honcho outage can't stall
  the chat turn.
- :func:`sync_turn` — fire-and-forget persist of the completed exchange
  so Honcho's server-side extraction can update the peer card. Accepts
  ``co_present_person_ids`` to add all distinct humans in a thread
  (Discord, Slack channel, email cc) as peers in the same Honcho
  session — the data shape that makes peer-of-peer reasoning possible.
- :func:`directional_chat` — backs the ``ask_about_person`` Anthropic
  tool. Queries one peer's representation of another via Honcho's
  ``target=`` parameter (e.g. "what does Alice know about Bob"),
  returning the synthesized answer.

Both prefetch and sync_turn are no-ops when ``Settings.honcho_enabled``
is false or ``person_id`` is ``None`` (anonymous channel user with no
Person row). All Honcho calls are wrapped so failures degrade OE to its
pre-Honcho behaviour rather than break a turn. Every call writes one
``peer_memory`` audit row so the per-turn flow chart can render the
Honcho path alongside ``<retrieved_context>`` and ``<past_decisions>``.

Cache discipline: the returned block is short, query-shaped, and goes in
the user turn — it does NOT live in any cached system block.

# deeper levels unreachable — a caller that asks for ``medium`` under the
# default 3s budget times out *every* time and gets no peer memory at all,
# which is strictly worse than having asked for ``low``. And because prefetch
# degrades silently (returns "" on timeout), the turn just quietly runs
# memory-less; nothing surfaces the fact that the level is unusable.
#
# So scale the operator-configured base budget by level. The base stays the

# peer is the department itself (`department_<slug>`) instead of a
# Person.id. Two reasons for the parallel-but-separate API rather than
# overloading the existing functions with a `department_slug=` kwarg:
#
# 1. The disabled/no-owner short-circuits are different — `no_person`
#    vs `no_department` make audit-grepping for "which scope skipped"
#    cleanly separable.
# 2. Department turns naturally accumulate a *different* co-presence
#    shape (other dept slugs join the session, not just people), so the
#    write-path branches anyway. Keeping the functions split keeps each
#    one short enough to read end-to-end.
