"""Workspace settings: how this install is used, and in which time zone.

One row (``id = 1``) in the ``workspace_settings`` table of the episodic DB:

- ``mode`` — ``"team"`` (the default: a company with departments and people)
  or ``"solo"`` (one person using Open Executive just for themselves, so
  department check-ins do not run — see ``set_workspace_mode``).
- ``timezone`` — the user's IANA zone, or NULL to fall back to the
  ``USER_TIMEZONE`` setting (and then UTC). It drives the default times of
  the morning brief, end-of-day digest, reflection and (solo) weekly
  review, the zone the Executive
  resolves "tomorrow at 9" in, open-loop due dates, and the alert quiet
  hours when no zone was stored for them.
- The principal's role (``PrincipalRole``), all nullable: ``role_kind``
  (``owner`` / ``in_house`` / ``independent`` / ``other``), ``role_title``,
  ``reports_to``, ``remit`` (what they are responsible for) and
  ``measured_on`` (what they are judged on). Solo mode is for anyone using
  Open Executive for themselves — a business owner, an executive inside a
  larger organisation, an independent or fractional executive — and this is
  how the Executive and its specialists learn which. Only solo mode reads it
  (the solo org block and the specialists' ``<principal_role>`` tag); it is
  kept, not cleared, in team mode.
- ``company_domains`` — the company's own email domains (a JSON list), or
  NULL to derive them from the principal's addresses (``people.identity``).
  An address on one of them matches a teammate by its local part, so
  anna+x@acme.io is the Anna whose address is anna@acme.com.

The row lives in its own table rather than on ``CompanyProfile`` on purpose:
onboarding's commit and the form wizard rebuild the profile from scratch,
which would silently wipe it. It is per company (it swaps with a client slot
like the other company tables — see ``clients.slots._BLANK_WIPE_TABLES``).

Reads are always fresh (one small SQLite read) and never cached on a
``Session``, so a change applies to the very next turn. They are also
read-only: a DB file or table that does not exist yet reads as the defaults
and is never created by a read, so loops and tests against an unconfigured
DB leave no trace.
