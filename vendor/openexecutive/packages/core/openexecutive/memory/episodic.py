    alerts. Internal-channel rows and the `nudge_scan` heartbeat are excluded —
    they have no user-visible side effect, so they would inflate the
    "heartbeat" without representing anything the user did or saw.

    Buckets by calendar day (UTC) via `substr(...,1,10)`. Decisions/advice
    bucket by their `timestamp` (when they happened); fired actions bucket by
    `run_at` (when they fired), NOT `created_at` (when they were queued) — a
    cadence queued the night before should count on the day it actually fires,

    of the fix `_build_activity` defers: there is no `done_at` column, but for a
    done action `run_at` is the closest persisted proxy for fire time.)
    Workflow runs bucket by `updated_at` (completion), initiatives by
    `created_at`, resolved decisions by `resolved_at`, alerts by `created_at`.
    Returns `[(YYYY-MM-DD, count), ...]` ascending, covering only the last

    are simply absent — the caller fills the dense grid.

    **No length floor.** There used to be one on the combined user+assistant
    length, which discarded short instructions answered at length — on a live
    tenant it blocked every commitment the principal made while admitting only
    the long analytical exchanges that had none, and the extractor ran 13
    times storing nothing.

    Moving that floor to the user's side does not fix it, it relocates it: the
    canonical executive decision is a long analysis answered with "Approve
    option B." (17 chars) or "Do B." (5), and any floor high enough to skip
    "Done" (4) also skips those. Length cannot separate a decision from an
    acknowledgement — "Do B." and "Done" differ by one character and mean
    opposite things. A pass over an acknowledgement costs one utility-fast
    call and stores nothing, which is the right trade against losing
    approvals. If per-turn cost ever becomes the binding constraint, the lever
    is a semantic prefilter or a per-session cap — not a length proxy for a
    property it cannot measure.

    **Only the principal's own words.** `_is_valid_user_commitment` is the
    gate that tests for a commitment, and it does so by requiring a verbatim
    quote from `user_message`. That is only meaningful when `user_message`
    actually holds the principal's words. On a chat channel it does not: a
    teammate's Slack line would be stored in `decisions` with no speaker
    attached, indistinguishable from the principal's own; an inbound email
    body is text the sender chose, and a self-quote is free.

    So the speaker must be the principal on a surface that proved it
    (`orchestrator.content_trust.principal_speaking`) — the one rule the
    untrusted-content policy keeps for every surface. It used to be keyed on
    an empty `origin_channel` meaning "the web app", and the email poller left
    it empty too, so every stranger's email ran through the extractor with its
    body as the principal's words. The rule now asks for the principal's
    surfaces by name and fails closed on anything else.
