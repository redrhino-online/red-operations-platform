"""Compact open-alert digest for the chat user turn.

The ``/today`` page shows a synthesized "What's going on" narrative whose items
(e.g. "Gulf Coast Port Cyberattack") are drawn from the open alerts queue — the
same rows that render as proposal cards below it. But ``/chat`` never saw that
data, so when the principal clicked a briefing item (or just typed its name) the
Executive had no record of it and couldn't discuss it.

This renders the current open alerts into a compact ``<briefing>`` block that the
chat route injects into the **user turn** (never a cached system block, so prompt
caching is unaffected). It mirrors how ``/today`` builds proposals
(`api/routes/today.py`): company-wide, live ``unread`` rows (inside TTL,
not snoozed — see ``alerts.lifecycle.list_live_alerts``).

# Recently-closed items the digest names so the Executive can recognise work

# page a few minutes ago is simply absent from chat: asked to "record that as

# Bounded by both a count and an age. `alerts` has no closed-at column, so the
# window is on `created_at` — an old alert closed today will not appear. That
# is the conservative direction: the block can omit a handled item, never
# invent one. The window matches the ACTION alert TTL (`alerts.lifecycle`
# `_ttl_settings` → 14 days): an action item may sit unread that long, so a
# shorter window would miss most of the lifetime during which the principal can
# clear one. `_MAX_HANDLED` bounds each status's query and then the merged list,
# so the block is at most that many lines however the statuses split. The merge
# is ordered by `created_at`, not by when the row was closed — there is no
# closed-at column — so on a busy day the cap can drop a just-dismissed older
# alert in favour of newer ones.

    Company-wide and scoped to ``status="unread"``, mirroring ``/today``'s
    proposal build. ``category`` (``action``/``monitoring``) comes from
    :func:`openexecutive.briefing.ranking.score_and_categorize` so the Executive
    can tell an item awaiting a decision from a passive monitoring signal.

    ``trusted_ids``, when given, is filled with every LIVE alert id — including
    ones past the render cap, which is a token budget and not a trust boundary.
    This is what `ack_alert` accepts: `/today` shows up to ``BOARD_LIMIT`` cards and all of them are
    Discuss-able, so trusting only the printed subset refuses an ack on a card
    the principal is looking at.

    What the trust boundary does and does not do: it confines the model to ids
    the SERVER derived from the live board, so an id invented by the model, or
    quoted out of an alert body for a row that is closed, snoozed, expired or
    nonexistent, is refused. It does NOT make the model immune to being talked
    into acking the wrong LIVE card — one alert's attacker-controlled body can
    still argue for clearing another id that is genuinely on the board. Scoping
    trust to the single item under discussion would need the Discuss primer id
    carried server-side; it is not, so do not read this control as more than it
    is.

    Pure synchronous SQLite read — wrap in ``asyncio.to_thread`` at the call
