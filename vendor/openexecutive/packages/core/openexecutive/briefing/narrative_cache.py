"""On-disk cache for the on-page briefing narrative.

Mirrors `openexecutive.people.insights_cache`: a dedicated table in the
shared `./episodic_memory.db`, validated against an `input_hash` of the
briefing state. The narrative is one LLM call, so we never generate it on
the request hot path — `/today` serves the cached text instantly and, when
the state hash has moved, regenerates in a FastAPI background task (same
pattern as the per-person insight notes).

Keyed by a `scope` string rather than a person id: the principal's own
whole-company narrative lives under `"principal"` (the default) and may carry
what is private to them; an unrostered/unresolved viewer gets the shared
`"company"` narrative written from what everyone may see; each non-principal
teammate gets their own role-scoped narrative under `person:<id>` (see
`today._attach_narrative`).

    The one invariant that keeps this cache honest: **the key is a function of
    the model's input.** Anything the prompt renders is covered; anything it
    does not render cannot trigger a regeneration. Both properties are free,
    and they survive future edits to `render_briefing_context` without anyone
    remembering to update a field list here.

    Two earlier designs each broke one half of that, in opposite directions:

    * Keying on proposal headlines alone left the rendered activity block
      uncovered, so the header could describe a rail that had moved on.
    * Keying on the proposals' review fields (`review_verdict`, `review_note`,
      `why_now`, `recommended_move`, `due_at`) covered data the /today header
      never renders at all — it prints `headline[:160]` and nothing else — while
      `alerts.review` rewrites those fields with fresh LLM prose on EVERY pass,
      including its "still relevant, nothing changed" path. That regenerated
      every viewer's narrative several times a day to re-synthesize byte-
      identical input.

    ``scope`` keeps two viewers whose contexts coincide under distinct keys,
    ``NARRATIVE_PROMPT_VERSION`` invalidates every entry when a prompt is
    reworded, and the principal's local date (:func:`local_today`) gives a
    daily floor (it is also inside the rendered context's PERIOD line, but
    the quiet sentinel has no such line).

    ``mode`` is the workspace mode. Solo and team use different system
    prompts over what can be the very same context, so a solo key carries the
    mode and never matches a team one. Team keys leave it out, so they are
    unchanged from before solo mode existed and no team cache is invalidated.
