"""Shared Executive-voice briefing narrative.

One synthesizer (`synthesize_briefing_narrative`), two consumers with two
prompts:
  - the **on-page /today header** (`api/routes/today.py`) — a SYNTHESIS that
    does not re-list the cards rendered below it (per-viewer; served from
    `narrative_cache`, regenerated off the request hot path), and
  - the **standalone morning-brief DM** (`workflows/morning_brief.py`,
    `standalone=True`) — an enumerated brief, since the DM has no cards beside
    it.

(The EoD digest has its own separate prompt and does not route through here.)
Sharing the provider call + context rendering keeps both surfaces in the
Executive's voice while letting each use the right structure.

    ``mode="solo"`` renders goals at risk by area and drops the people
    block — the Executive coordinates nobody but the principal there, so
    there is no "waiting on" roster to render.

    Solo also renders ``today_data["due_soon"]`` (``open_loops.

    any of these, so a team context is unchanged.

    ``live`` (``briefing.live_signals``) is the principal's world in the

    reflection's "Flagged for the brief" text (quoted). With none of these
    the output is byte-identical to before they existed.

    ``standing_facts`` is the STANDING FACTS block (``memory.facts``), last;
    None reads the store, "" leaves it out. ``teammate_changes`` is the
    morning brief's TEAMMATE CORRECTIONS SINCE LAST BRIEF block
