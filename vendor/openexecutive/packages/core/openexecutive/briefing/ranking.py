"""Score and categorize briefing proposals.

The briefing was drowning in low-signal watchlist/stock alerts ("X moved
4.8%, no obvious driver") that are unrouted — so they pile into the
principal's "Needs you" queue and crowd out work that genuinely needs a
decision. This module separates the two:

  - ``category`` — ``"action"`` (a human should look) vs ``"monitoring"``
    (passive awareness; safe to collapse). Watchlist/external signals that
    are unrouted and not high-severity are ``monitoring``.
  - ``score`` — a sort key (higher = more attention). Severity dominates;
    a routed/assigned alert and recency add weight. Used to order the
    ``action`` queue so the sharpest item leads.

Pure functions — no I/O — so they are trivial to unit test and cheap to
call per alert inside ``_build_today``.
