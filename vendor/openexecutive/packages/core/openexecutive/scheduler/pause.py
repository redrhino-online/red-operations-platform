"""Global pause switch for the Executive's autonomous work.

One operator-level flag, persisted in the episodic DB, that every autonomous
loop checks at the top of each iteration:

- ``scheduler.runner.run_scheduler`` — claims nothing (briefs, nudges, alert
  review, monitoring, cadences, scheduled outbound messages all wait),
- ``integrations.email_poller.run_email_poller`` — leaves Gmail unread,
- ``workflows.resumer`` — applies no ``wait_for_human`` timeouts and resumes
  no answered runs.

Pausing holds work; it never cancels it. Due ``scheduled_actions`` stay
``pending`` and fire on the first tick after resume. Work already running
when the pause lands finishes. Inbound conversations (web chat, Slack,
Discord, Telegram, Google Chat) are deliberately NOT gated — pausing stops
what the Executive starts on its own, not its answers to people.

``is_paused`` fails CLOSED: a DB file or table that does not exist yet reads
as "running" (nothing was ever paused), but a read *error* on an existing DB
reads as "paused" — for a brake, the safe failure is holding work, never
silently releasing it while the UI still shows "paused". A broken DB would
stall ``claim_due_actions`` anyway; the hold is logged once per failure
streak. It is also read-only — it never creates the DB file or the table —
so loops running against an unconfigured or test DB leave no trace.

The table survives client-slot swaps (``clients.slots._GLOBAL_TABLES``): the
switch belongs to the operator, not to whichever client company is active.
