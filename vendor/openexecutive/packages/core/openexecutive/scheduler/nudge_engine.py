"""Proactive nudge engine — periodic heartbeat that decides what to chase.

The Executive used to be purely reactive: it only sent proactive messages
when the user explicitly asked for a follow-up (`schedule_followup`),
when a department cadence fired (`dept_cadence`), or when an alert was
triaged. Stalled workflows, open commitments, and idle initiatives sat
silently. This module fills that gap.

A `kind="nudge_scan"` scheduled action fires every
``NUDGE_SCAN_INTERVAL_MINUTES`` (default 15) from the existing scheduler
runner. Each tick:

  1. Deterministically selects candidates from three sources:
       a) ``workflow_runs`` rows with ``status='awaiting_human'`` whose
          timeout is within ``NUDGE_STALLED_LEAD_HOURS`` and whose last
          update is older than ``NUDGE_STALLED_MIN_QUIET_HOURS``.
       b) ``scheduled_actions`` rows with ``awaiting_response_since``
          older than ``NUDGE_COMMITMENT_STALE_DAYS`` — or, for
          ``kind="open_loop"`` rows (attunement/open_loops.py), whose due
          time has passed. Loops past ``ATTUNEMENT_LOOP_TTL_DAYS`` are
          expired at the start of each scan.
       c) Active initiatives whose ``updated_at`` is older than
          ``NUDGE_INITIATIVE_IDLE_DAYS`` (and whose dept cadence
          hasn't refreshed them in the meantime). Owned by the department
          head, else by the principal; a principal no channel reaches gets
          a weekly Briefing card instead of the nudge.

  2. Dedups each candidate against past nudges via the ``scope_key``
     column on ``scheduled_actions`` and per-source cooldowns.

  3. Picks a delivery channel per candidate via
     ``people.channel.prefer_channel_for`` — respecting availability
     windows and quiet hours. Defers via ``next_available_window`` when
     the assignee is temporarily unreachable.

  4. Emits ``kind="proactive_nudge"`` rows with the resolved
     ``(channel, channel_ref, run_at)``. The scheduler runner's existing
     ad-hoc dispatch path picks them up and asks the Executive to write
     and send the actual message — no new delivery code path.

This mirrors ``departments/cadence.py`` (``bootstrap_cadences``,
``enqueue_next``) and reuses the runner's polling / claim / retry
machinery, so there is no second background loop and no separate
single-worker contract.
