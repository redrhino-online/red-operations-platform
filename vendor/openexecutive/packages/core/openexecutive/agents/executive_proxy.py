"""Thin BaseAgent subclass so the Executive can participate in the Agent Council.

The ExecutiveProxy is NOT registered in SPECIALIST_REGISTRY and is never used for
routing. Its only purpose is to give the agents API route a uniform interface for
building AgentMeta / AgentDetail and to surface effective_*() override resolution
for the Executive's prompt and model.

The test-box endpoint calls proxy.analyze() directly — this makes a single-turn
completion, which is the correct "does this prompt produce sensible output?" check.
