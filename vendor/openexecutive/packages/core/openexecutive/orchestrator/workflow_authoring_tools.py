"""Anthropic tools that let the Executive author user-created workflows in chat.

Two fixed tools implement a **draft → confirm** handshake:

1. ``draft_workflow`` — the Executive proposes a complete definition. The
   handler validates it but does NOT persist; it returns a ``confirm_token``
   (a hash of the canonical definition) plus a human-readable summary the
   Executive shows the user for approval.
2. ``save_workflow`` — after the user approves, the Executive calls this with
   the same definition and the token. The handler recomputes the token and
   refuses on mismatch, so the saved workflow is exactly what the user saw.

Both tool schemas are fixed (no per-definition tools), so the cached tool list
stays stable. No new outbound capability is granted: approval-gate and cadence
recipients must be rostered people (enforced by ``validate_definition``), and
cadence delivery reuses the scheduler's existing guarded send.

A workflow with action (tool-using) steps is saved **inactive**. The chat
confirmation is a token this model holds itself, so it cannot stand in for a
person seeing the tools; the workflow runs (or schedules) only after someone
turns it on from its review card at ``/jobs/{name}``.
