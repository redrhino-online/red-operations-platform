"""Anthropic tool definitions + handlers for managing department Goals.

These tools let the Executive update a Goal's `status` and/or `current`
progress text directly from a chat turn — used when the user reports
progress on a tracked Goal ("we shipped the billing migration") or a
setback ("we lost the Acme deal"). They close the loop that Phase A's
`department_check_in` workflow opened — chat-driven activity now feeds
the same `last_reviewed_at` column the cadence-driven review writes to.

`create_goal` starts tracking a NEW goal the principal states ("20
paying clients by the end of Q4"), filed under an area / department named
by slug or title — creating that area when none matches. Only the
principal, on a surface that verified it is them, may call it (the roster
tools' rule): a goal renders in every turn's org block as one of the
principal's own, so a goal from an inbound email, a teammate or an
unattended run would be text with the principal's authority. Its schema is
static (the area is free text, not an enum of the current departments), so
adding an area never changes the cached tool prefix.

Sit alongside `people_tools`, `schedule_tools`, `broadcast_tools`, and
`alert_tools` in the Executive's main tool loop. No authority gate —
the goal-mutation surface is principal-editable at any time through the
UI, so a chat-turn change is no riskier than a manual edit; the audit
row carries `rationale` for accountability. No unattended run
(reflection, research, the scheduler's proactive trigger) is offered
`create_goal` (`schedule_tools.UNATTENDED_WITHHELD_TOOLS`).
