"""What an answer looked at, and which part of it had to be left out.

The web chat route (``api/routes/chat.py``) owns one ``TurnSources`` per turn.
It sends it after the reply as a ``sources`` stream event, stopped and
timed-out replies included, and saves it with the message
(``chat_messages.sources``). No other channel collects it.

- **Sources** are what the answer *looked at*: the documents its knowledge
  searches returned and the web pages its searches returned. They are not a
  claim about which sentence came from where. Knowledge retrieval records
  them through ``retrieve(record_source=...)``. That covers the Executive's
  own search and each specialist that answered; a specialist that failed
  never passed its documents on, so they are left out. The Executive records
  the pages its reply cites and a few results of each web search. Cited
  pages are always kept ahead of the rest.
- **Unavailable areas** are parts of the analysis (finance, legal, ...) whose
  specialist failed or said nothing every time it was asked this turn, so the
  reply went ahead without them. They are named by area, never by
  specialist: the user only ever meets one Executive (CLAUDE.md — the agent
  architecture is never exposed).
