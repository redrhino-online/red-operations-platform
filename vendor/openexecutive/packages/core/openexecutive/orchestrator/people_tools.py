"""Anthropic tool definitions + handlers for managing the People roster.

These tools let the Executive add, update, archive, list, and assign
department heads directly from a chat turn — no UI round-trip required.

They sit alongside `create_alert`, the schedule/send tools, and
`consult_specialist` in the Executive's main tool loop.
