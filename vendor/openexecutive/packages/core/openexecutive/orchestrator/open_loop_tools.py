"""Chat tools over attunement open loops — what each person owes.

``list_open_loops`` answers "what is Sara waiting on / what does Ben owe me?".
What people owe can be sensitive, so the principal sees everyone's loops only
in a private conversation (web chat or a 1:1 DM); anyone else, and the
principal in a shared channel, sees only their own.
``close_open_loop`` closes one the user says is done or no longer needed, so
the nudge engine stops chasing it. ``assign_open_loop`` opens one on request
("ask Ben to send me the Q3 numbers by Friday"): the deterministic path, where
the post-turn extraction pass only catches what its English keyword prefilter
and its model happen to.

Assigning is gated on who is asking and on their own words. Only the principal
or a rostered teammate, on a surface that verified who they are and in a turn
someone is watching, may assign — never an email, a turn private to the
principal, or an unattended run (those are also withheld the tool). The task
text must appear verbatim in what the speaker typed this turn: it is re-injected
into the nudge intent a tool-using turn executes, so it is never the model's
paraphrase (or words lifted from a document or a quoted message).

Closing is gated on who is asking. Loop ids appear in the reflection prompt and
in chat replies, and inbound email reaches the Executive, so a quoted "close
loop 12" from an outsider must not work: only a turn whose resolved speaker is
the principal or the loop's owner may close it. The unattended reflection pass
is not given this tool at all.
