"""Chat tools that make a correction stick everywhere.

``remember_fact`` stores a fact or a correction the principal states in the
standing-facts store (``memory/facts.py``), which renders into every prompt
that produces output — chat turns, scheduled runs, the /today header and the
morning brief, the alert review, the specialists and the review workflows.
``forget_fact`` retires one. ``update_company_profile`` changes a field of the
company profile (``company/profile.yaml``) from chat, the same file the
Company page edits.

All three are the principal's, on a surface that verified it is them — the
``record_decision_outcome`` rule: a standing fact is read by every later
prompt, so one from a forged email or a run nobody is watching would be text
carrying the principal's authority. ``remember_fact`` is also open to a
teammate on the People list talking from a surface that verified who they are
(the web app signed in, their own Slack or Discord). Their fact is attributed
— rendered "(per <name>)", so no prompt reads it as the principal's — and is
held as a proposal until the principal approves it on the Pulse page, unless
the principal marked that teammate trusted ("needs my approval" off;
``memory.facts``). Even a trusted teammate's fact that would replace one the
principal set is held. A proposal never renders. Retiring a fact
and editing the company profile stay the principal's alone.
The principal's own email (their primary address, DMARC passing, not mail
they forwarded) is checked like chat, then held: the change applies only when
a one-time token emailed to that address comes back in their reply
(``integrations.fact_confirmation``), since a From line alone proves nothing. No unattended run is offered them
(``schedule_tools.UNATTENDED_WITHHELD_TOOLS``), nor is a turn private to the
principal (``schedule_tools.PRIVATE_TURN_WITHHELD_TOOLS``): what they write,
or retire, is read on everyone's turns.

A write also needs ``source_quote``: the speaker's exact words from this
message (at least two words and eight characters), checked against what they
typed this turn — never the backstory an adapter hydrates a reply with, and
nothing at all when the message carries an attachment. It is the provenance
the Pulse page shows the principal, and it keeps the model from storing its
own inference, a document's figure or text quoted back at the principal as
something they said. The quote alone only proves they asked; so a
remember_fact statement's figures, names and date words, and an
update_company_profile value, must be in their words too.

Every audit row these tools write, and the chat loop's dispatch row for them
(``executive._private_tool_row``), is private to the principal: the dispatch
row's input quotes them verbatim, and both tie a fact to their chat session
and turn — provenance ``GET /memories/facts`` hides from teammates, who can
otherwise read any audit row.
The schemas are static, so the cached tool prefix never moves.
