    One specialist that raises, or returns no text, no longer fails the
    batch: its result becomes `specialist_unavailable_result`, its index in
    ``calls`` goes into ``failed_calls_out`` (in call order), and the others'
    results stand.
    Cancellation (the user pressing Stop) still propagates. ``record_source``
    receives each document the knowledge retrieval of a specialist that
