"""Deterministic policy for what the research pass may put on the watchlist.

The research workflow's watchlist pass used to call ``add_watchlist_entry``
directly: whatever the model proposed landed, live, with no rationale, at
``cadence=15min`` / ``severity_floor=low`` and (for feeds) no keyword
trigger — so one unfiltered competitor blog could out-noise the whole
watchlist. The model now only *proposes* (``propose_watch``); this module
decides, and it decides from company data, not from the model's confidence
in itself.

Two tiers:

- **direct** — added live, quietly (daily cadence, medium floor, keyword
  trigger). Requires the grounding entity to be *in company data* (a named
  competitor / vendor / ticker / initiative / priority / the company itself,
  or an entity a department lists under its watched entities) plus enough
  corroboration (see :func:`classify`). This is the "high likelihood, worth
  watching — just add it" case.
- **suggest** — inserted in ``dry_run`` (polls, never alerts) with
  ``origin=research_proposed``; the principal — or, when the grounding term
  belongs to a department, that department's head — approves or declines
  it on ``/watchlist``. This is the "not sure" case.

Company data is more than the static profile: a department's watched
entities, charter scope and goals, and the entities named in recent
episodic decisions all feed the grounding vocabulary, and a term that came
from a department carries that department along so the watch (and every
alert it raises) is routed to it.

A proposal with nothing vouching for it (no linked finding, score 0), one
for a source already watched, one past the enabled-watch ceiling or the
per-run budgets, is rejected; a target or entity the principal declined is
refused in the tool handler before the model can route around it with a
new slug. Every decision is audited with its score and reasons.
