"""Insert-time validation + normalization of watchlist targets.

The watchlist is largely populated by an LLM (the ``executive_research``
workflow) proposing ``rss`` feed URLs it never verified — historically
the great majority were dead (404 / 403 / not-actually-a-feed), producing
a watchlist full of rows that fetch nothing and a permanently-empty
briefing.

This module validates an ``rss`` target at insert time: it must fetch and
parse as a feed with entries. A target the server *answers* but that
isn't a feed is either:

  - converted to a ``page_watch`` when the page the feed check already
    fetched yields readable text (a news or pricing page with no feed), or
  - rejected (:class:`WatchlistTargetError`) when it does not,

so a dead ``rss`` row never reaches the scan loop. A transient / network
blip passes the target through unchanged rather than blocking a
legitimate add on a hiccup. Every non-``rss`` type returns unchanged with
no network I/O.
