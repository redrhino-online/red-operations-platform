"""Who has Act as me on, and whether this turn may use it.

One row per person in ``delegation_settings``: a person turns it on for
themselves (``PUT /delegation``), and nobody turns it on for anyone else.
Absent, unreadable or off all mean off.

**Who may have it.** ``can_delegate`` is the single rule: the principal, and
a team member (not a contact, not archived) once the owner has let team
members use it (``team_members_enabled``: the ``DELEGATION_TEAM_MEMBERS``
install setting makes the owner's switch available, and the owner's switch in
``delegation_team`` turns it on). Each still turns it on for themselves.
Everything else here is keyed by person. What a teammate's mailbox touches is
private to *that* person, not to the principal: audit rows carry
``private_to_person`` (``audit.rows_for_person``), a reply card is its
approver's alone (``DecisionClassSpec.approver_only``), and a conversation
that read their mail is theirs alone (``session_store.mark_mail_private``).

**Per turn.** ``pin_turn_delegation`` runs at the start of every chat turn
(``Executive.stream_chat`` and the committee path), next to the workspace-mode
pin, and records a ``TurnDelegation``: whether the speaker has it on, whether
``ghostwrite_email`` is offered this turn, and — set by the tool — whether the
turn has touched the speaker's mailbox (every audit row the turn writes after
that is private). The pin is held in a context variable for the turn's task as
well as on the session, so two turns running at once on one session (a second
browser tab) each read their own. It is offered only when all of these hold:

- the speaker may have it (``can_delegate``) and turned it on;
- the speaker is on a surface that verified it is them
  (``people_tools.is_principal_on_verified_surface`` for the principal,
  ``teammate_on_verified_surface`` for a team member), and a web turn also
  carried a signed-in caller (``x-caller-email``) or runs under local login.
  A request with no caller header is not a sign-in and never gets it. Whoever
  holds ``BACKEND_SHARED_SECRET`` is trusted as the UI proxy that stamps that
  header, as on every principal-only route;
- the conversation is private to the speaker: the web chat, a Slack or
  Discord DM, or a verified private Telegram chat — never a shared channel or
  thread, where a draft's preview or the matching threads would be posted for
  everyone and other people's messages sit in the model's context;
- the turn is not unattended and not private to the principal (the email
  poller's turns), so inbound text can never reach it.

The Gmail connection is deliberately NOT part of the offer: the handler checks
it on every call and says how to fix it, and the tool list (a cached prefix)
does not flip when a token lapses.

**The system prompt.** ``block0_delegation_on`` is the install-level flag the
cached persona block keys its constant ``DELEGATION_ADDENDUM`` on — whether
anyone here may have it and has it on — so it changes only when a setting
does, never per turn or per speaker.
