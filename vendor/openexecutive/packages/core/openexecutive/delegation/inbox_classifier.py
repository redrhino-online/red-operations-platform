"""Does this email need a reply from the person? The inbox watcher's first
model call (``delegation.inbox``).

One forced tool call (``classify_email``) returns ``{needs_reply, kind,
confidence}``, and code decides: a draft is written only when the email needs
a reply, is a kind worth answering (a question, a request, scheduling, an
introduction, a follow-up), and the confidence clears a bar that rises the
less the sender is known: 0.6 for the team or a contact, 0.7 for someone the
person has written to before, 0.85 for a stranger (and for anyone whose
address Gmail couldn't authenticate: ``inbox.handling_relation``). Anything
else, and any failure, means no draft.

The model sees a few header lines and the sender's own new words (quoted
replies stripped, at most 3000 characters), as data in a labelled block. It
has no tools but this one, no company context and no memory, so the email can
ask for anything and there is nothing here to do it with. The prompt is a
constant, and short enough that it is not cached.

Answer through classify_email:
- needs_reply: true only when the sender is waiting on this person to write \
back — a question for them, something asked of them, a meeting to arrange, an \
introduction they should acknowledge, a follow-up on something they owe. \
False for anything sent to many people, anything automatic, and anything that \
needs no answer.
- kind: question, request, scheduling, introduction, follow_up (it needs a \
reply), or fyi, thanks, pitch (a cold sales or partnership email), \
notification, newsletter, phishing (it asks for credentials, payment or a \
click with urgency or a disguised sender), other.
- confidence: how sure you are that needs_reply and kind are right, from 0 to 1.
