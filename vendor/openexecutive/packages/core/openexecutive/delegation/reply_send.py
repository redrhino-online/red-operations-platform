"""Send a reply the inbox watcher drafted, when the person taps Send.

The one path in Act as me that sends anything, and all it can send is the
exact draft on a ``delegation_reply`` card, by its id
(``DelegateGmail.send_draft`` posts ``{"id": ...}`` to ``drafts.send``;
``DelegateOutlook.send_draft`` posts nothing to that draft's ``send``),
after the person approved that card (``POST /decisions/{id}/approve``, a
class only the card's own person sees or resolves). Only that route calls ``send_approved_reply`` (a unit
test walks the code), so no model, chat turn, workflow, scheduled job or MCP
call can reach it. Sending is the person's own act: it works while the
Executive is paused.

At send time it checks again, in this order:

1. The caller is the person the card belongs to, and the API knows it:
   signed callers are on (``CALLER_ASSERTION_PUBLIC_KEYS``) and the caller is
   that signed-in person (or the local operator under local login), or the
   API runs for local login, answering this computer only. Anything else is a
   409 ``caller_signing_required``: with only a shared secret, whoever holds
   it could send as the owner.
2. Act as me and Draft replies to my inbox are both on, and no client slot is
   active.
3. Their Gmail is connected (``gmail_status``).
4. The draft still exists, in the same thread, and they haven't replied
   there themselves since (either way the card closes).
5. Its recipients: someone, at most 10, never the Executive's own address,
   and it is from one of their own addresses.
6. What changed since the card was made needs a second yes: recipients that
   differ from the card's, or a newer message in the thread. The first tap
   gets a 409 ``confirm`` naming the recipients; the second tap sends them
   back (``{"recipients": [...], "thread_moved_on": true}``).

Then it claims the card (``claim_for_execution``, proposed → executing, a
compare-and-set: a double tap sends once), reads the draft once more and sends
only if it is still the version checked above (``drafts.send`` sends whatever
the draft is when Gmail gets the request, so an edit made meanwhile in another
tab is refused, not sent unchecked), and records it (``finish_execution``:
``approved_with_edit`` when the draft was edited in Gmail). A failure that
shows nothing was sent hands the card back. One that leaves it unclear (a
timeout, a 5xx) leaves it ``executing`` for the reconciler
(``inbox._settle_unconfirmed_send``), which asks Gmail what happened. Nothing
is ever retried on its own. Every row it writes is private, and the card's
person's own (``rows_for_person``).
