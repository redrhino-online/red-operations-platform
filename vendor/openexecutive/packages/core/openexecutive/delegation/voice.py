"""How I write: a short profile of how a person writes their own email.

``attunement.style`` learns how the Executive should write *to* someone. This
learns how someone writes *themselves*, so a draft in their own Gmail reads
like theirs. It is only ever read by ``delegation.ghostwriter``, for that same
person's drafts.

**Learned from their sent mail, on request.** ``learn_from_sent_mail`` reads
up to 40 recent messages from the person's own Sent folder (through
``delegation.gmail``), keeps only what they wrote — quoted replies stripped —
and skips automatic mail, every thread chat drafted into and every sent
message that began as a draft written for them, so the profile learns them
rather than itself. One forced-tool model call returns the
profile; code validates every field before it is stored:

- habits and things to avoid: short sentences about the *writing* (length,
  tone, greetings, punctuation…), through the same deny-list as working-style
  rules (no actions, links, handles, amounts, tool names or roster names);
- greetings and sign-off: short, no links or handles;
- exemplars: at most three short passages, each checked to be verbatim from a
  sample, emails and phone numbers masked — and none at all while a client
  slot is active, so one client's mail never lands in another client's state;
- the signature comes from Gmail's own settings (``sendAs``), not the model.

**The person stays in charge.** ``GET/PUT/DELETE /delegation/voice`` show,
edit, lock and reset it. A locked profile is never relearned, and every
change is kept in ``delegation_voice_history``.
