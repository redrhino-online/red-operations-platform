"""Anthropic ↔ OpenAI-format request/response translation.

OpenRouter exposes an OpenAI-format ``/api/v1/chat/completions`` endpoint
(no Anthropic-Messages-compatible URL). To avoid rewriting every
Anthropic-shaped call site, we keep the internal request/response shape
Anthropic-native and translate only at the OpenRouter boundary.

The translator is intentionally functional — three pure helpers — so
the matrix of (system blocks, tool use, streaming tool fragments) is
testable in isolation without an HTTP client or an event loop.

What we DO NOT translate:

* ``cache_control`` blocks pass through unchanged when present. We
  preserve them on system content, user-turn content, tool entries, and
  tool-result content (the agent loop's intra-turn breakpoint)
  so OpenRouter can forward the Anthropic cache hints to the upstream
  Anthropic call (see OpenRouter prompt-caching docs:
  https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/best-practices/prompt-caching).
  For non-Anthropic slugs the feature_gate has already stripped them
  before we get here, so the no-cache_control path falls back to the
  legacy string-flatten form for maximum upstream compatibility.
* Anthropic thinking / output_config blocks are NOT forwarded verbatim —
  OpenRouter has no ``thinking`` field. When feature_gate has preserved
  them (Claude family, or a catalog model that advertises ``reasoning``
  support) ``to_openai_request`` translates their intent into OpenRouter's
  unified ``reasoning`` parameter (``{"effort": ...}`` for adaptive
  thinking, ``{"max_tokens": N}`` for a legacy ``budget_tokens`` request).
  OpenRouter maps that onto each vendor's native form (Anthropic budget /
  effort, OpenAI reasoning effort, Gemini thinkingLevel, …). The
  ``reasoning`` / ``reasoning_details`` fields OpenRouter adds to the
  response are ignored by the response path — only ``content`` and
  ``tool_calls`` are read. See
  https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/best-practices/reasoning-tokens.
* Web-search server tools — feature_gate strips these only for the local
  OpenAI-compatible backend. For every OpenRouter model the Anthropic
  ``web_search_*`` server tool (which OpenRouter can't execute as-is, and
  which has no ``input_schema``) is replaced in ``tools[]`` by OpenRouter's
  own ``openrouter:web_search`` server tool with the same ``max_uses`` and
  domain lists, so the search cap and filters hold on this path and the
  response's ``usage.web_search_requests`` is recorded. See
  https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/features/server-tools/web-search.
  OpenRouter's search makes the model cite results with
  ``(cite index="...">…</cite>`` markup; the response path strips that
  markup so it doesn't leak into findings / chat text.
