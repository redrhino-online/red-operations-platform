"""Spec-driven stripping of Anthropic-only request features.

When a non-Claude model is selected (or a Claude model is routed via a
backend that doesn't honor Anthropic-only features), we strip the
unsupported fields before the request leaves our process. The gate is
applied inside the OpenRouter provider so any future re-routing keeps
the same guarantees — a caller cannot accidentally ship a request with
``cache_control`` to a model that would 400 on it.
