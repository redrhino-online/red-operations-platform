"""Open loops — what each person owes, tracked until it's done.

Until this existed, commitments were only captured from the principal's own
words (``memory.episodic.should_extract``), and nothing in production ever set
``scheduled_actions.awaiting_response_since`` — so the nudge engine's
commitment source had nothing to chase. A teammate's "I'll send the vendor
quote by Thursday" simply vanished.

Now, after every chat turn from a rostered speaker, one narrow extraction pass
(behind a cheap keyword prefilter and a daily call budget) can:

- **open** a loop — a ``commitment`` the speaker made ("I'll send it
  Thursday"), an ``ask`` the speaker made of a named rostered person, or, when
  the principal speaks, a commitment the principal attributes to a named
  teammate ("Sara will send the numbers Monday");
- **close** loops the speaker reports done ("sent it") — their own loops, or
  any loop when the principal says so.

Every item must quote the speaker's own message verbatim, so the Executive's
suggestions are never logged as someone's promise (the same hard gate the
episodic extractor uses). The stored text must be verbatim too: it is
re-injected into the nudge intent, so it is never a model paraphrase.

The principal's own commitments are dropped in a team install (they are the
episodic extractor's job). In solo mode — one person using Open Executive for
themselves, with nobody else to chase — a commitment of the principal's that
states when it is due ("I'll send Northwind the proposal by Friday") IS opened
as a loop they own, so it is chased when due and listed in their brief; an
undated one ("I'll look into pricing") is an initiative and stays dropped.

Storage is ``scheduled_actions`` with ``kind='open_loop'``, inserted already
``done`` on the ``__internal__`` channel so the runner never dispatches it,
``assigned_to_person_id`` = the owner and ``awaiting_response_since`` = the due
time. That is exactly the shape the nudge engine's commitment source reads, so
an overdue loop gets chased through the existing routing, availability windows
and outbound guard, and ``/today``'s per-person "awaiting" counts include it.
Closing a loop clears ``awaiting_response_since``. A partial unique index on
``scope_key`` over open loops dedupes concurrent passes.
