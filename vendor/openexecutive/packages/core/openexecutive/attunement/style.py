"""Working style — a short "how to work with you" block per person.

Open loops and the outcome ledger make the Executive proactive about each
person. This module tunes how it *talks* to them: at most
:data:`MAX_RULES` short style rules ("lead with the recommendation, then the
numbers"), pinned into that person's own turns as a ``<working_style>`` block.

**Evidence, not impressions.** A rule is learned only from that person's own
attributed messages (``chat_messages.sender_person_id``) and their own
reactions to the replies: 👍/👎 they left themselves
(``feedback_by_person_id``), with any note, and replies they stopped
mid-stream. Every rule must cite that evidence:

- ``feedback`` — at least one cited reply carries one of those reactions;
- ``stated`` — the person asked for it in so many words, and the rule quotes
  that request verbatim from a cited message.

Honcho is never read or written here, so this works the same with
``HONCHO_ENABLED=false``; with Honcho on, ``<peer_memory>`` carries what
Honcho knows about the person and this block carries only what their own
reactions show.

**Style only.** Rules come from what people wrote, so they are validated in
code before they are stored: a length cap, one line of Latin-script text, a
deny-list that rejects anything that reads as an instruction to act (send,
approve, pay…) or to act without checking (skip confirming, proceed), names
a tool or a person on the roster, or carries a URL, handle, amount or
markup — and an allowlist: the rule must name some aspect of how a reply
reads (length, format, tone, detail, what to lead with…). The lists are
lexical, so they narrow rather than close the space; what bounds the risk is
that a rule only ever reaches its owner's own turns and is learned from (or
typed by) that owner or the principal — neither of whom gains anything a
rule gives that they could not already say in the message itself. The block says the current request always wins and that the rules
never authorize an action, and it only ever reaches that person's own turns.

**Pacing.** A pass runs in the background after an attributed turn once
``ATTUNEMENT_STYLE_TRIGGER_TURNS`` new messages have arrived since the last
one, or right after the person leaves a 👎. It runs at most once every
``ATTUNEMENT_STYLE_MIN_INTERVAL_HOURS`` and ``ATTUNEMENT_STYLE_MAX_PER_DAY``
times a day per person, and draws on the shared ``ATTUNEMENT_MAX_CALLS_PER_DAY``
budget. The claim is one conditional UPDATE, so concurrent triggers run it once.

**People stay in charge.** ``GET/PUT/DELETE /people/{id}/attunement`` (the
principal or that person) show, edit, lock and reset the rules. A locked
profile is never rewritten by a pass, and a pass never overwrites an edit made
while it ran. Every change is kept in ``attunement_profile_history``.
