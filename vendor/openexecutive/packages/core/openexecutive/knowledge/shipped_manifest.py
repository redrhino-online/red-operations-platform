"""The built-in knowledge files that SHIP with Open Executive.

This list is the *only* source of truth for content provenance. It cannot be
derived from the filesystem at runtime: `POST /knowledge/builtin` writes a
user's own document into the very same `knowledge/builtin/<domain>/` tree
(`api/routes/knowledge._resolve_path`), so "there is a .md file at this path"
is equally true of shipped content and of a confidential draft someone just
uploaded. Re-deriving provenance from the tree marked those uploads as shipped
and auto-approved them into retrieval.

`ReviewStore.sync_builtin_registrations` registers exactly these paths as
trusted defaults. Anything else in the tree belongs to the user and reaches
`review_items` through `ReviewStore.register()`, which never sets
`trusted_default`.

Regenerate after adding or removing a built-in knowledge doc:

    git ls-files 'packages/core/openexecutive/knowledge/builtin/**/*.md' \
      | grep -v '/skills/' \
      | sed 's#packages/core/openexecutive/knowledge/builtin/##' | sort

`tests/unit/test_review_store.py::test_shipped_manifest_matches_git` fails if
this drifts from the tracked files.
