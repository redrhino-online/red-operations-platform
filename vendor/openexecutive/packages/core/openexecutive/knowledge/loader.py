    ``attachment:q4-plan.md`` — matching on the name alone would migrate a
    real company document out of the collection it belongs in, and (because
    the file is still on disk) the boot reconcile would re-index it as
    ``general`` on the way back, widening it to every specialist. So the name
    has to be corroborated by ``domain="company_docs"``, the value the old
    attachment path always wrote and the one value ``UPLOAD_DOMAINS`` will
    never accept from an upload.

    ``type="attachment"`` is checked first as defence in depth: this change
    introduces the tag, so no shipped build ever wrote one into COMPANY, but
    a row carrying it is unambiguously ours.

    ``startswith``, not ``in`` — ``attachments-policy.md`` is a document about
    attachments, not an attachment.

    Attachment rows used to be written into ``company_docs`` and kept out of

    them (see knowledge.general_catch_all in architecture-facts.yaml).
    Isolation is now the collection, and the rows already in COMPANY have to
    follow.

    Returns the number of chunks actually removed from COMPANY — not the
    number attempted. A row that was copied but not deleted is still
    retrievable, so reporting it as moved would announce the leak as closed
    while it is open.

    Idempotent: ids are reused verbatim, an id already present in the
    destination is left alone, and once a run completes the scan that
    precedes it finds nothing.

    Synchronous on purpose. Every step here blocks — the metadata scan, the
    text fetch, the embedding pass inside ``add_documents`` — so the caller
    has to put it on a thread rather than merely scheduling it on the event
    loop, which would defer the stall without avoiding it.

    A note for anyone reading a zero on an install that certainly received
    attachments: before this change the ingest path built its store with the
    bare ``ChromaDBStore()`` default rather than ``settings.vector_store_path``,
    so wherever those differ the rows went to a different database than the
    one the API reads. In a container that directory is outside the data
    volume and goes with the container; elsewhere it persists as a stray
    ``<cwd>/chroma_db`` that no wipe path reaches and an operator should
    remove by hand. Either way it is unreachable from here, and zero is the
    honest answer rather than a failure.
