# Chroma's DefaultEmbeddingFunction builds a new ONNXMiniLM_L6_V2 on every
# call, so every query and upsert loads the model from disk (about 200 ms a
# query). Its ONNX session also keeps the CPU memory arena on and embeds 32
# texts per run, each padded to 256 tokens, so a large ingest peaks several
# hundred MB above the model. The stores share one session per process
# instead, with the arena off and _EMBED_BATCH texts per run: the same model,
# the same vectors, a bounded peak.
#
# It answers to DefaultEmbeddingFunction's name ("default") with an empty
# config, which is what existing collections record: Chroma refuses to open
# a collection with a differently named function, and rebuilds "default"
# from the stored config if older code opens one this created. It must NOT
# be a DefaultEmbeddingFunction instance: Chroma's Collection._embed skips
# any such instance and embeds with a fresh one from the config instead.
