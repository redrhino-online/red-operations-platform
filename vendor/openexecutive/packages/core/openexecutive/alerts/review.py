"""Executive alert review: re-examine open alerts with evidence, then act.

The "Needs you" queue used to be write-once: an alert was raised and never
looked at again. This job closes that loop. Every ``ALERT_REVIEW_INTERVAL_HOURS``
(and once right before the morning brief) it:

1. **selects** live alerts old enough to be worth a second look and not
   reviewed inside the interval (:func:`select_candidates`);
2. **gathers evidence** per alert — newer signals from the same watch, related
   alerts raised since, Executive activity since, the watch's trust score, the
   roster slice that could own it, and workflows that plausibly fit
   (:func:`gather_evidence`);
3. asks the :class:`~openexecutive.agents.alert_review.AlertReviewAgent` for a
   verdict + recommended move per alert (the model never mutates anything);
4. **applies** each verdict through deterministic policy (:func:`apply_verdict`):
   close only on high confidence with named evidence, otherwise annotate;
   route / nudge / escalate / draft / merge / suggest a workflow within
   department authority and the board/comp/legal privacy rule, capped per
   pass, every move audited with its evidence and prior state, every close
   reversible via ``POST /alerts/{id}/reopen``.

Heartbeat plumbing (``alert_review_scan`` rows) mirrors ``scheduler/nudge_engine``.
