"""Alert lifecycle: time-to-live, the "live" read view, and the expiry sweep.

An alert used to leave the ``unread`` queue only when a human acked or
dismissed it, so the briefing's "Needs you" list grew without bound and the
daily briefs re-listed the same rows every day. This module gives every alert
a deterministic lifetime and one read helper every surface shares:

- :func:`ttl_days_for` — per-category TTL (monitoring vs action), from
  settings; ``None`` for sources that own their own lifecycle (artifacts
  persist in the gallery, decision-backed alerts end via approve/reject).
- :func:`is_expired` — pure predicate over an ``Alert`` + ``now``.
- :func:`list_live_alerts` — ``unread`` rows that are neither past their TTL
  nor snoozed. ``/today``, the chat ``<briefing>`` block, the briefs and the
  reflection all read through this, so the page is correct even before the
  sweep has run.
- :func:`expire_stale_alerts` — the sweep the scheduler runs every 15 minutes
  (and once at startup): flips past-TTL ``unread`` rows to ``expired`` and
  audits the batch. ``expired`` is just "not unread": the activity feed and
  the artifacts gallery keep showing the rows, and ``POST /alerts/{id}/reopen``
  brings one back.

Kept free of briefing/route imports at module level (only lazy imports inside
functions) so ``alerts.store`` stays a leaf and this module can be imported by
the scheduler, the routes and the workflows alike.
