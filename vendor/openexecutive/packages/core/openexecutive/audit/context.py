"""Audit context — propagates session_id / turn_id to fire-and-forget emit sites.

A single Executive turn fans out across many helpers (retriever, specialist
routing, cache_manager probe, tool dispatch). Threading session_id + turn_id
through every signature would touch ~30 call sites and break unrelated
abstractions. ContextVars give us per-task propagation that's automatic
across `await` boundaries while staying scoped to the current asyncio task —
no global state, no cross-talk between concurrent chat turns.

Usage:

    from openexecutive.audit.context import set_turn, get_active_ids

    with set_turn(session_id="discord:dm:42", turn_id="t-abc"):
        await executive.stream_chat(...)   # retriever et al see the IDs

    sid, tid = get_active_ids()            # outside: both None

The context manager *resets* the vars on exit, so nested or stacked turns
restore prior values cleanly. This is the same pattern used by
`orchestrator.schedule_tools.current_session`.

    Implementation note: we *save the prior value and restore it on exit*
    rather than using ``ContextVar.set()``/``reset(token)``. The Token
    variant raises ``ValueError: <Token …> was created in a different

    one ``__enter__`` ran in — which happens when this manager wraps an
    ``async for`` over an async generator whose iteration crosses task
    boundaries (FastAPI's SSE driver, httpx-backed streaming, anything
    that suspends/resumes the generator outside the original asyncio
    Task). The save/restore pattern is Context-independent and produces
