"""SQLite-backed audit log writer + reader.

Design notes:
- Stores into the same `episodic_memory.db` SQLite file used by alerts/episodic
  memory so there is one place to look. New table only — no schema migrations
  for existing tables.
- `summary` is the searchable, human-readable column (max ~300 chars). It is
  what users grep for in the UI. `details_json` carries opaque structured
  fields (token counts, durations, channel refs) and is not searched.
- Writes swallow exceptions: an audit failure must never break a chat turn or
  a tool call. We log a warning and move on.
- A row can be private to the principal (`private_to_principal`): every row
  a turn about their private mail writes, and a row on their own turn that
  names one of their contacts (`people_tools.audit_row_private_to_principal`,
  decided at write time — the `audit.context` scopes included, for rows
  written before a turn binds its session), plus any row a caller marks
  `private=True`. The read API (`api.routes.audit`) leaves those rows out
  for anyone else.
- A row can also belong to one team member alone (`private_to_person`):
  what their own mailbox touched under Act as me (`audit.rows_for_person`, or
  a turn that read their mail). It is private and, unlike the principal's,
  left out of every read here unless the caller asks for that person's rows
  (``owned_by``) — the principal included. Only the usage totals count it.
