"""Per-call model usage recording.

Every model call the system makes (Executive chat turns, specialist consults
and workflow specialist steps, specialist research, the research synthesis
and watchlist passes, triage, the chat memory extractor, the Council test
boxes) records one ``cache_event`` audit row through
:func:`log_model_usage` — tokens, cache hits, provider-reported cost, and the
server-side web searches the call made. ``GET /audit/usage`` and the
per-session cost view sum those rows, so a run's weight can be read from the
audit log instead of guessed.

The ``actor`` column names the source of the call (``executive``,
``specialist`` for chat-turn consults, ``specialist_workflow`` for workflow
steps, ``specialist_mcp`` for the MCP consult tool, ``specialist_research``,
``research_synthesis``, ``research_watchlist``, ``triage``,
``memory_extractor``, ``agent_test`` for the Council test boxes), which is
what the per-source breakdown groups on. A research run binds its
``run_id`` in a ContextVar for its
duration so every row the run produces carries it in ``details``; the
workflow then rolls those rows up into the ``usage`` block on its result.
