"""Authority gate for department-scoped proactive actions.

The gate is consulted whenever a scheduled proactive action has a department
slug — it reads the department's authority_level and decides whether the
action should execute immediately, be proposed to an approver, or be
escalated to an approver as urgent. Only `execute` runs the action;
`propose` and `escalate` both wait for a person to approve it. A
`dept_cadence` fire is the exception: the check-in it runs sends nothing
and gates each action it proposes.

All callers are expected to pass `now` explicitly so the gate is
deterministic and easy to test without time mocking.
