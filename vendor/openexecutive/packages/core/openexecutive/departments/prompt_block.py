"""Render current department state into a compact Markdown block for the
5m-TTL system prompt cache slot.

Called by `prompts.cache_manager.build_system_blocks` on every turn. The
result is appended after the company-profile block; the 1h persona and
knowledge blocks are never touched.

Key invariants:
- Output must be deterministic for the same DB state (no timestamps, UUIDs,
  or non-deterministic ordering). Determinism keeps the 5m cache warm.
- Output is capped at _ORG_BLOCK_CHAR_CAP characters so a department with
  many Goals never inflates the system prompt.
- An empty departments table (fresh install, test env) returns "" so no block
  is appended — the function must never raise.
- Phase 3 extended this to include a compact People roster below the
  departments section. The People section is omitted when no People are seeded.
- Solo mode (one person — the principal — uses Open Executive;
  ``render_org_block(mode="solo")``) renders a different, smaller block: the
  principal's own line and their goals grouped by *area* (a department row is
  an area there). No authority levels, heads, cadences, channels or roster —
  the principal decides, and the people in their world are contacts, not a
  team the Executive routes to. Same determinism, sanitizing and cap. When
  the workspace holds the principal's role (``memory.workspace_settings.
  PrincipalRole``: kind, title, reports to, remit, measured on), its lines
  follow the principal's own line — the context the solo persona reads the
  principal's role from. Set once per install, so the 5m cache stays warm.
- The principal's contacts (people outside the team) get their own short
  "## Contacts" section after the team or solo block — name, role/company and
  whether an email is on file, nothing about authority — but only when
  ``include_contacts`` is set, i.e. on the principal's own verified turn:
  contacts are private to the principal. Every other turn gets the block
  byte-identical to one with no contacts at all, so per mode the 5m cache
  holds at most two stable variants, never a per-request one.

Security note: Goal text fields (key_result, current, target, mission) are
user-controlled strings that land inside the system prompt. All values are
sanitized via _safe() before rendering to prevent prompt-injection via
embedded newlines, Markdown headings, or instruction-like text.
