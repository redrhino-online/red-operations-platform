"""Discord bot integration for Open Executive.

Mirrors the structure of slack_bot.py. In production the bot is embedded in
the FastAPI lifespan (api/main.py) so it shares the same /data volume as the
API. `run_discord_bot()` / `python -m openexecutive.integrations.discord_bot`
is a standalone dev entry point — useful for iterating on bot-only changes
without restarting the API. Run it only while the API is stopped or has no
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN: the lifespan starts its own bot whenever the token is set,
and two gateway connections on one token reply to every message twice. Both rely on `create_discord_bot()` returning a
`commands.Bot` whose `.start()` / `.close()` work in any event loop.

Supported interactions:
- DM the bot → Executive replies in DM
- @mention in a guild channel → Executive replies in a thread
- /ask <prompt> slash command → deferred Executive reply
- /today slash command → Today dashboard summary
- post_notification() helper for outbound alerts/digests

    history for the session (i.e. this was the first turn). Callers use it to
    trigger thread renames; pass None to opt out.

    `attachment_blocks` is a list of Anthropic image content blocks assembled
    by process_attachments(). Text-extracted document content is expected to
    already be prepended to `text` by the caller.

    `attachment_count` is how many files the message carried, recorded in the
    audit row. It is passed separately from `attachment_blocks` because the
    caller skips attachment processing for an unrostered sender — that is
    exactly the case where /audit should still show a file was sent.

    `response_router`, if provided, is awaited with the full reply text
    AFTER ``executive.chat`` returns and BEFORE the chunked send loop.
    The returned :class:`MentionRouteResult` selects the actual ``send_fn``
    (so the route decision sees the full reply, not just the first chunk)
    and optionally surfaces a brand-new bot-owned thread whose session
    should also receive the turn (double-write) so future thread-
    continuation messages have the original Q+A in context. Used by the
