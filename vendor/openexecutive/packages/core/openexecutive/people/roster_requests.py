"""Roster requests: the ledger behind "is this Annamarie? add her".

When someone who is not on the roster writes in (an email address, a Slack
or Discord user, a private Telegram chat), their message is held here as a
*roster request* for the principal to answer, instead of being dropped:

- **approve** — add them as a new person (team or contact) with this
  address or chat id;
- **link** — they are someone already on the roster writing from a new
  address or account: attach it (an email alias, or the chat id);
- **decline** — leave them off. A declined sender is not asked about again
  for ``DECLINE_QUIET_DAYS``.

The principal answers from the web card on /today, from their own verified
Slack / Discord / Telegram DM (the ``resolve_roster_request`` chat tool), or
by replying from their own address to the confirmation email, which carries a
one-time token (``issue_email_token``). All three end in ``resolve``.

This module is the store and the state machine only: no channel sends. What
happens around it — the acknowledgement to the sender, notifying the
principal, replaying held messages once someone is added — lives in
``integrations.roster_intake``.

Privacy: a request is the principal's alone (its routes answer 404 to anyone
else, its /today card is private, its audit rows are private). A held
message's text is kept only until the request is resolved or expires.
