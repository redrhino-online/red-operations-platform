"""Who an email address belongs to: aliases and the company's own domains.

A Person has one primary address (``Person.email``, the one they sign in
with) and any number of aliases (``person_emails``). Mail is matched to its
sender here, in this order:

1. Exact: the address is someone's primary or one of their aliases
   (case-insensitive; the team row wins over a contact).
2. Company domain, team only: on one of the company's own domains, the
   address's local part (lowercased, ``+tag`` dropped) matches the local part
   of a teammate's address on any company domain — anna+invoices@acme.io is
   the Anna whose address is anna@acme.com. A domain alone never proves who
   someone is: an unknown local part on the company domain matches nobody
   (it becomes a roster request, pre-filled as a teammate). When two
   teammates would match, nobody does (fail closed).

The company's domains are the ``company_domains`` workspace setting, or,
when that is unset, the domain of the principal's primary address — never a
free-mail provider's (gmail.com and the like), where a local part says
nothing about who someone is.

Sign-in is not matched here: ``people.store.find_person_by_email`` (primary
only) is the sign-in lookup, so an alias never grants web access.

The outbound gates use ``RosterAllow``, built from the same rule, so the
Executive may email exactly the addresses inbound mail would match.
