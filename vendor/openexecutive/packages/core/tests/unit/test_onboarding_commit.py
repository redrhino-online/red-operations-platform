"""Persisting a reviewed onboarding draft: people + the ADDITIVE department reconcile.

The department half is the reason this file exists. ``cli/fixture_loader``
seeds departments by DELETing every row first — correct for swapping in a demo
company, and destructive here: it would drop the eight defaults along with
their ``specialist_key`` wiring, which ``create_department`` (always
``specialist_key = NULL``) cannot restore. These tests pin the additive
behaviour so nobody "simplifies" it into the fixture seeder later.
