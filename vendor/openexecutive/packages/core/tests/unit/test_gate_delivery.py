"""A wait-for-human gate must record where its answer will come from.

Before this module existed, `dynamic.py` built the gate with empty `channel`,
`channel_ref` and `outbound_message_id`, both checkpoint sites wrote that empty
state straight to `workflow_runs.state_json`, and nobody was ever actually
asked. The run sat at `awaiting_human` until it timed out, and the inbound
resolver's channel filter could never match a reply (#136).

Two modes and three ways delivery can fail to happen are pinned here. The
failure modes matter as much as the happy path: a suppressed or undeliverable
question must NOT leave routing fields behind that imply someone was asked.
