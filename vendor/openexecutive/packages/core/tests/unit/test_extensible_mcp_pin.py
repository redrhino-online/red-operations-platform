"""Guards the extensible-mcp pin shared by the MCP gateway and the API image.

The gateway launches extensible-mcp with ``uvx --exclude-newer <cutoff> --from
git+...@<commit>`` and the Dockerfile pre-warms uv's cache with the same
invocation. The commit pins extensible-mcp's code; the cutoff pins the
resolution of its dependencies, which uvx otherwise redoes against PyPI on
every networked start. Both invocations must match exactly: a mismatch means
the image caches one set of packages and the runtime resolves another, which is
the floating-code problem the pin exists to remove, plus a startup that needs
the network.
