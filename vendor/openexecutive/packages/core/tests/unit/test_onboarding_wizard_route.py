"""HTTP-level tests for the company-onboarding wizard's final step.

Regression for issue #84's second half: ``/onboard/answer`` used to commit the
final answer (``completed=True``) *before* building the profile. When the
build raised, the client got a 500 and every retry hit "Onboarding already
completed" — the only way out was to restart onboarding from scratch.
