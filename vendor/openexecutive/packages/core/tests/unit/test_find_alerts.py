"""`find_alerts`: reaching an item that has scrolled off the live board.

`ack_alert` only accepts ids the server put in front of the model this turn,
recorded by `briefing.context.render_and_trust`. That set is the LIVE board —
unread, inside TTL, not snoozed — which is right for the cards the principal is
looking at and wrong the moment they name one that has left it.

Observed: a principal asked to retire three duplicate alerts they had already
opened. The Executive named all three ids correctly and then refused, because by
then the rows were `read` and off the board.

So `find_alerts` widens the set, within bounds that `TestTheWideningIsNotAHole`
shows refusing: only in a turn `render_and_trust` showed the principal their
own board (an empty set is how every other turn refuses acks, and a default
`Session()` has one), only ids its own SQL returned, only still-open rows,
never roster-request cards, and at most 25 per turn across calls.
