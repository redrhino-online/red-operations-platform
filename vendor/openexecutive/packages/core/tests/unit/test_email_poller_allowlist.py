"""Inbound sender policy for the email poller.

``_handle_email`` routes EVERY non-automated inbound to the Executive,
regardless of whether the sender is in the People roster. Auto-reply
protection lives on the OUTBOUND side: the MCP gateway's
``_check_gmail_recipients`` refuses Gmail-send tools when the recipient
isn't rostered. The poller additionally prepends a [POLICY] notice to
the message body the Executive sees when the sender is unrostered, so
the model doesn't waste a turn discovering the block by attempting a
send.

History: silent-drop-on-non-roster was the prior behavior. Removed
because it prevented the Executive from classifying cold inbound (e.g.
a prospect reaching out for the first time) — the whole point of the
triage agent. The roster gate moved out of the inbound path and into
the outbound tool calls.
