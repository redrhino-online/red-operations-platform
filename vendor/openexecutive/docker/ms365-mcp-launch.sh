# Launcher for the Microsoft 365 MCP server (@softeria/ms-365-mcp-server), run
# as a STDIO child of the API's MCP gateway (extensible-mcp). The Executive
# consumes this server's Outlook mail + calendar tools through that gateway —
# the Microsoft analogue of docker/workspace-mcp-launch.sh.
#
# Co-located in the API image (not a separate service): the gateway spawns it
# on demand from /data/company/mcp_servers.json, which points `command` here.
# See docs/deployment.md → "Microsoft 365 credentials".
#
# Auth is MSAL device-code (delegated, single mailbox). The refresh token
# persists under MS365_MCP_CREDENTIALS_DIR on the API's /data volume so a
# one-time `--login` survives restarts. All of these vars reach this script
# because the gateway forwards them to extensible-mcp (_FORWARDED_ENV_VARS in
# orchestrator/mcp_gateway.py) and the microsoft_365 entry's `env` block passes
# them on to this child.
set -eu

# extensible-mcp resolves the `$VAR` placeholders in the config's `env` block
# from the API's environment — and leaves an UNSET one as the literal string
# "$VAR". Left alone, that literal would pass the "is it empty?" checks below
# and reach MSAL as a bogus client id / tenant ("$MS365_MCP_TENANT_ID"), which
# fails only at the first Graph call with an authority error nobody can read.
# Scrub any such placeholder back to "unset" before deciding anything.

# Tool surface: an EXPLICIT allow-list (--enabled-tools, an anchored regex of
# tool names), not the upstream `mail,calendar` preset. The preset also
# registers tools that can address people the gateway's roster gate does not
# see — forward-calendar-event, create-/update-mail-rule (silent inbox
# forwarding), update-mailbox-settings (external auto-reply), calendar
# permission sharing, whole-calendar delete — and an upstream bump can add
# more. The list below is exactly the Outlook mail + calendar tools the
# gateway gates or that carry no recipient; the scopes requested at --login
# follow from it (Mail.ReadWrite, Mail.Send, Calendars.ReadWrite). The
# server's account tools (login, logout, verify-login, list-accounts,
# select-account, remove-account) are always registered regardless of the
# filter; the gateway refuses login / logout / select-account /
# remove-account itself (orchestrator/mcp_gateway.py).
#
# OneDrive (opt-in, MS365_MCP_ONEDRIVE=true): the same surface the Executive
# has on Google Drive — search, list, read (download-bytes, pinned by the
# gateway to mail attachments and drive file content), upload / edit, create
# folders, move, rename, copy, and share. The two sharing tools are gated like
# Drive sharing: every invitee must be on the People roster, and a link must
# be scoped to specific people; writes are kept to the Executive's own drives
# and search to plain words (orchestrator/mcp_gateway.py). Delete is left out.
# The tool scopes are Files.ReadWrite (the account's own drive, where every
# write lands); --extra-scopes adds Files.Read.All so files and folders shared
# WITH the Executive can be read too, which is also what the OneDrive folder
# sync (knowledge/onedrive_sync.py) reads with. Files.ReadWrite.All is not
# asked for: nothing writes outside the Executive's own drives.
#
# It is opt-in because the server asks for every scope of its tool list on
# each token refresh: turning it on for a sign-in that never granted the file
# permissions would fail every Microsoft 365 tool, mail and calendar
# included, until `--login` is run again.
